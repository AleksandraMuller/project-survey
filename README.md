# Survey Form built with React --> :newspaper:

This is a survey form built with React Hooks. In this project I use React useState hook and I connect HTML form inputs to state.

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning :hammer:

This short survey in built with funcional React.
The project is divided into multiple Components (each input, select, radio buttons and submit button are into separate Components).

I use the state to pick users answers, which I later re-use to show the summary of all the answers that we get from the user. I use state in order to hide some parts of the form.

If I had more time, I would focus on validation, accessibility and styling.

## Deployed version :rocket:
